# PANDA Planning and Acting in a Network Decomposition Architecture

PANDA is a planning architecture consisting of various components for planning
and acting in a hierarchical planning framework.

It contains different planning systems (capable of solving different kinds of 
planning problems, including both hierarchical and non-hierarchical problems),
components used for the verification of plans (is the given plan a solution to
the given planning problem?), as well as more practice-oriented components, such
as for plan explanations (answering questions like "why should I perform this action?"),
or plan repair (finding new solutions if execution errors arise).

At the moment, not all these components are delivered, yet. More precisely, our 
components for plan explanation, plan repair, and our SAT-based HTN planner PANDA-totSAT
are not yet delivered -- but they will be soon.

Call PANDA.jar with -help to get detailed information and instructions.

## Building PANDA

To obtain an executable jar of PANDA, you need an installation of the 
simple build tool (version 0.13.9 or higher). If you have, please run

    sbt main/assembly

in a command line.

The second-last line of the commands output will tell you where sbt has put the jar file.
