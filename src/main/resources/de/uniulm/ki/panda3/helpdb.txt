For most parameters, their order does not matter.
Parameters can be freely interleaved with the specification of domain-, problem-, and output-file.

PANDA3's general call syntax is as follows:
    java -jar panda3.jar [OPTIONS] domfile.xyz [OPTIONS] probfile.xyz [OPTIONS] [outputfile.{pdf|dot}] [OPTIONS]
